# Sentiment-Score-of-Mr.Trump
To perform the sentiment analysis of Mr.Trump after the election

There are lot of stages of talk after Mr.Trump's victory, so just wanted to analyze a sentiment score of the tweets collected after 24 hours of election. Basically Sentiment Analysis is a major subject in machine learning which aims to extract subjective information from the textual reviews. The field of sentiment of analysis is closely tied to natural language processing and text mining.It can be used to determine the attitude of the reviewer with respect to various topics or the overall polarity of review. Using sentiment analysis, we can find the state of mind of the reviewer while providing the review and understand if the person was “happy”, “sad”, “angry” and so.

I just collected 15,000 tweets, I know that is a small number. After that I have downloaded a list of positive and negative words. I have created and have written a function for analyzing the sentiment score, where

I initially performed data cleaning by removing the "Punctuation marks", "emojis" and all of the extra things except words.
I have compared the tweet of words with the positive and negative words available as a dictionary.
Created a sentiment score based on the word count of positive and negative words.
So on Overall I created a sentiment score of Mr.Trump after the 24 hours of election. I have used the tweets which i have collected after 20 hours of election.
